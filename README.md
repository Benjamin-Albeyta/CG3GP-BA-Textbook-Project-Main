Instructions on how to test:
- Build and run
- There are basic camera and movement controls implemented:
Left Click to shoot, WASD to move and a first person camera (I tried my best on implementing this because it was easier to control / use for testing)
If all enemies are defeated then there will be a circle for a victory screen, if the player dies or the base loses all its health there will be a square for a loss.
- Basic AI for enemies is also implemented, they will move towards the player or the base depending on positioning.
