Instructions on how to test:
I'm going to be honest, there really isn't anything to test at this point, it's just a couple of scenes that you can look through, there's no functionality besides basic player movement and even then I don't know how to get the scene containing that to be shown.\
So I don't know what I'm supposed to put here besides the fact that it does in fact build and compile.
